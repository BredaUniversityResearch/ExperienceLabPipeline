%% UPDATE_PARTICIPANT_DATA
%  function project = get_participant_data(cfg, project)
% 
% *DESCRIPTION*
%   compares the participant data to the project struct and if there are
%   diffrences, it ask the user how to handle these
%   1)  participants are added, i.e. the participant data file has participant 
%       labels that are not in the project:
%       = Ask whether to add these to the project
%   2)  participants are removed, i.e. the project has participant labels 
%       that are not in the participant data file:
%       = Ask whether to remove these to the project
%   3)  start/end times have changed, i.e. for a participant the start 
%       and/or endtimes of a segment in the participant data file are 
%       different from those in the project:
%       = Ask whether to update the times in the project
%         Note that if times change, the bookkeeping of that participant of
%         that segment will be set to false for segmentation, artifact
%         correction, and deconvolution
%
% *INPUT*
% A project struct containing the name and path of the project and data
