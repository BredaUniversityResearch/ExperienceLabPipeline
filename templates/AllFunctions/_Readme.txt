This folder contains scripts & examples of all matlab functions developed and used.

Blocks of these functions can be copied and pasted, and if desired used within your own project.

Contrary to the Templates, these blocks do not create a ready to go matlab script to copy paste and run, instead it contains multiple segments, which can be run individually to show how the functions could be used
